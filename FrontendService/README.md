### API Integration

The frontend communicates with the UserService backend through:

- **Registration**: `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
- **Login**: `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
- **Get Current User**: `GET /api/v1/auth/me`
- **Logout**: `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`

### Environment Configuration

The application uses Docker networking to communicate with the backend:
- Frontend runs on port 3000 (mapped to host)
- Backend API calls are proxied through Nginx to `userservice:8080`
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage for session management

### Docker Setup

1. **Development**: The app is built using Node.js and then served via Nginx
2. **Production**: Optimized static build served by Nginx Alpine
3. **Networking**: Connected to backend via Docker bridge network

### User Experience Flow

1. **Landing**: Users are redirected to login if not authenticated
2. **Registration**: Multi-step form based on user type selection
3. **Authentication**: JWT tokens manage session state
4. **Dashboard**: Personalized welcome page with user information
5. **Logout**: Clean session termination with backend notification

### Form Validation

- Email format validation
- Password strength requirements (minimum 6 characters)
- Required field validation based on user type
- Real-time error messaging
- Password confirmation matching

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly form controls
- Readable typography across devices

### Security Features

- JWT token storage and automatic inclusion in requests
- Token refresh handling (future implementation)
- Protected route guards
- Input sanitization and validation
- CORS handling through backend configuration

This frontend provides a complete authentication experience that integrates seamlessly with the Dhatree UserService backend!
